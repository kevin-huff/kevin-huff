### Hi, I'm Kevin! 👋🎉

🚀 Welcome to my GitHub cosmos! I'm Kevin, a PHP maestro 🎵 and a Drupal artisan in the public sector. But that's just the tip of the iceberg!

👾 I love crafting digital wonders for streamers and their vibrant communities. Here, you'll stumble upon my treasure trove of creations – from whimsical one-offs to nifty tools for friends. 🌟

🔧 These days, I'm often seen orchestrating DevOps magic for businesses, streamlining pipelines, and deploying with finesse. My GitHub is a showcase of this journey – where technology meets practical business solutions.

🤖 Since chatGPT entered the scene, I've been on a thrilling adventure pushing the boundaries of possibility! Check out my repositories for a sneak peek into this journey.

🎨 When I'm not coding, you might find me right here at my computer doing other nerd stuff.
